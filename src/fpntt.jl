# Floating-point NTT multiplication following FLINT's fft_small design:
# coefficients live in Float64, products use the FMA error-free transform,
# and quotients use the magic-constant round.  The operands are split into
# b-bit chunks and the convolution is computed by CRT over two just-under-2^50
# primes (working modulus p1·p2 ≈ 2^99.99, so b ≈ 46 at typical sizes,
# shrinking slowly with operand length — see fp_ntt_params).
#
# Arithmetic model.  Values are exact integers in balanced representation,
# |x| < a few p.  Every operation is exactly correct (not approximately):
#   - a ± b is exact while |a ± b| < 2^53.
#   - fp_mulmod(x, w[, wpinv], F) returns r ≡ x·w (mod p) exactly:
#     h + l == x·w exactly (FMA error-free transform), q is an integer
#     within (1/2 + |x·w|·2^-52/p) of x·w/p, and r = x·w - q·p is an
#     integer small enough to be exact through the final fma and add.
#   - fp_round(v) = (v + 1.5·2^52) - 1.5·2^52 rounds exactly to the nearest
#     integer for |v| <= 2^51.
#
# A transform of length N = m·2^k (m | 315, 2^k | p - 1) is a flat list of
# uniform FpNttStage passes — the odd radices (7/5/3, radix 3 up to twice) first, then the
# radix-4 tower, plus a twiddle-free radix-2 pass when k is odd.  The reverse
# transform (fp_ntt_rev!) runs the same stages in reverse order; each stage's
# transpose reuses its forward tables (the DFT matrices are symmetric), so
# the whole network computes the same DFT.  Fed the forward-scrambled
# pointwise product it returns N·c[(N-t) mod N] in natural order; the unpack
# reads descending and folds in the 1/N.
#
# Lazy bounds, at p < 2^50 (write κ = p·2^-52 <= 1/4; a constant mulmod on
# |x| <= c·p returns <= p(1/2 + c·κ/2) since all stored tables are minimal
# balanced, |w| <= p/2).  One fp_reduce per butterfly closes the per-stage
# ranges (the ω^0 lane, which skips the twiddle mulmod, is reduced explicitly
# — see the butterfly comments for the per-radix numbers).  The global
# invariant: forward values converge to <= ~1.0p (so pointwise products stay
# <= p², round argument <= p), reverse raw stores to <= ~3.3p, every constant
# mulmod's round argument to <= (4p)·(p/2)/p = 2p < 2^51, and every
# intermediate sum to <= ~4.2p < 2^53/p = 8p.  The minimal-balance clamp on
# the tables is load-bearing: float-generated constants drift to ~0.8p, and
# 3.6p·0.8p breaks the 2^51·p round domain.  The differential and adversarial
# max-magnitude tests validate the ranges empirically.
#
# All bounds hold for any prime p < 2^50, so the engine is parametrized by an
# FpCtx carrying the per-prime constants and both residue transforms run
# through the same code.
#
# Hardware FMA and round-to-nearest are assumed.  No @fastmath anywhere near
# this file: contraction would break the fma(x, w, -h) cancellation.

# input size, and 5 of them accumulate).  y0 comes back unreduced; the

# Garner recombination + limb streaming.  (Unpack loads reverse-transform

# stays <= ~1.7p < 2^51.)  fp_ntt_rev! hands back N·c index-
# reversed (coefficient i at (N-i) mod N); this loop scales each residue by 1/N
# and Garner-combines the two mod-p residues of every base-2^b coefficient:
#   c = c1 + p1·u,  u = (c2 - c1)·p1^-1 mod p2.
# c is never materialized — by linearity Σ cᵢ·2^(b·i) = S1 + p1·S2 with
# S1 = Σ c1ᵢ·2^(b·i) and S2 = Σ uᵢ·2^(b·i), so the two sums stream independently
# (S1 into r, S2 into s2) and one final addmul_1! folds them at kernel speed.
#
# Each c1, u is pre-split into window halves lo = v << s, hi = v >> (64 - s) so
# the scalar accumulate is pure add-with-carry; s = (b·i) mod 64 is data-
# independent because the flush drops s by exactly 64.  The 128-bit window never
# overflows: values are < 2^50, s < 64, and each flushed limb is final (later
# coefficients start at a strictly higher bit).  Note c1 must be canonicalized
# before fp_reduce(v1, F2), since v1 - p1 is a different value mod p2.
