# NativeBigInt.jl

Pure-Julia arbitrary-precision integer type (`NBig`) targeting GMP-competitive
performance from ~100 bits up. Requires a recent Julia (uses `Memory{UInt64}`).
Headline results (details and tables in Benchmarks below):

- `+`/`-`/`*`/`divrem`: faster than GMP through ~4k bits; `*` pulls ahead
  again from ~10k bits as the fp NTT takes over, growing to 2–4× from
  ~35k bits up.
- `gcd`/`gcdx`: within ~25% of GMP across the range, ahead from ~16k bits
  (subquadratic HGCD).
- `powermod`: parity around ~16k bits, ahead above (NTT-backed Barrett
  reduction).
- `isqrt`: within ~15% of GMP across the range, ahead below ~512 bits and
  above ~32k.

## Algorithms

Three layers, mirroring GMP's mpn/mpz split: raw limb kernels, sign-free
mpn-style algorithms over limb buffers, and the `NBig` value type on top.
Dispatch thresholds are benchmark-tuned (`bench/bench_kernels.jl`).

- **Kernels (`src/kernels/`):** sign-free limb-vector primitives —
  `add_n!`/`sub_n!`, `mul_1!`/`addmul_1!`/`submul_1!`, `mul_2!`/`addmul_2!`,
  `mul_basecase!`, `lshift!`/`rshift!`, `cmp_limbs`. Division uses a
  reciprocal-based `divrem_1!` (Möller–Granlund 2/1 normalized inverse, with
  a fused-shift path for unnormalized divisors), `div_3by2` for quotient
  estimation, and `divrem_bc!` — a radix-β² Knuth Algorithm D that produces
  two quotient limbs per pass via chained `div_3by2` estimates and a SIMD
  `submul_2!`, with a small-quotient subtraction fast path for near-equal
  bit lengths. Kernels are written so LLVM emits `adc`/`mulx` chains, with
  SIMD.jl fast paths and scalar cold paths for carry-chaining edge cases.

- **Multiplication (`src/mul.jl`):** subtractive Karatsuba (threshold ~29
  limbs) with a general unbalanced-operand path; `mul!`/`sqr!` hand off to
  the fp NTT at ~152 (mul) / 160 (sqr) balanced limbs. The NTT benchmarks
  better than Toom-3 at every size (and thus presumably better than the
  higher-degree Toom variants), so no Toom layer exists. `mullo!`/`sqrlo!`
  are exact low short products (result mod β^k): truncated paired-row
  basecases at 0.55–0.75× the full product deep into the Karatsuba range, a
  Mulders split (~0.69k full low block + two recursive cross products) above
  `MULLO_BASECASE_THRESHOLD`/`SQRLO_BASECASE_THRESHOLD`, and plain `mul!` +
  discard once the balanced product reaches the NTT.

- **fp NTT multiplication (`src/fpntt.jl`):** the sole large-size engine —
  number-theoretic transforms computed entirely in `Float64` in the style of
  FLINT's `fft_small`, with the convolution recombined by CRT over two
  just-under-2^50 primes (p₁ = 65205·2^34 + 1, p₂ = 2^50 − 2^38 + 1, both
  with 3²·5·7 | p−1; the ≈2^99.99 working modulus keeps the chunk width at
  ~46 bits at typical sizes, Garner recombination in the unpack). Products
  use the FMA error-free transform, reduction is a Barrett quotient via the
  magic-constant round, and twiddles are stored as Shoup-style `(w, w/p)`
  pairs — every operation is exactly correct by rounding-error analysis, not
  approximation, with lazy per-butterfly bounds keeping the hot loop pure
  mul/fma/add traffic (the analysis lives at the top of `src/fpntt.jl`).
  Radix-4 DIF forward; the inverse is the transposed forward network (same
  tables, reverse stage order — no inverse twiddles or 1/N pre-scale pass).
  Transform lengths are m·2^k for m | 315 (Winograd radix-3/5/7 passes,
  radix 3 up to twice) with bench-placed per-multiplier admission floors, so
  zero-padding waste is ≤ ~12.5% at small sizes and ≤ ~7% once transforms go
  DRAM-bound. Squaring runs one forward transform instead of two.

- **Division (`src/div.jl`):** multi-limb `divrem!` — Knuth Algorithm D over
  `divrem_bc!` below ~100 limbs, GMP-`dcpi1`-style divide-and-conquer
  division above (recursive 2n/n blocks over `mul!`, so it inherits
  Karatsuba and the NTT; 0.82–0.96× GMP's `mpn_tdiv_qr` from the crossover
  through at least 2048 limbs). `divappr!` is the quotient-only variant: a
  one-sided approximate quotient (never below the true one, within
  `DIVAPPR_ERR = 32` ulps) that skips all remainder work, via a
  triangle-truncated basecase and a dc recursion that peels the top quotient
  half exactly.

- **gcd (`src/gcd.jl`):** Lehmer gcd/gcdext (Knuth Algorithm L) on 126-bit
  leading windows — two bracket-verified single-word phases per window,
  one fused matrix pass over the operands, and for gcdx a V-cofactor pair
  carried in lockstep. Above ~300 limbs (gcd; ~250 for gcdx) a subquadratic
  HGCD layer in the style of GMP's `mpn_hgcd` (Möller 2008) takes over:
  recursive half-gcd builds a 2×2 matrix of det-+1 mpn cofactors whose
  products route through `mul!`, for an O(M(n) log n) total — ahead of both
  the Lehmer loop and GMP's `mpn_gcd` from ~600 limbs (1.2× at 2000 limbs,
  widening).

- **Higher-level algorithms (`src/algorithms.jl`):**
  - *sqrt:* Karatsuba square root (Zimmermann), each level dividing the
    halved numerator by the top of the root buffer in place (no divisor
    construction or per-level renormalization). For `isqrt` above ~4k bits
    the top level is root-only: `divappr!` with one guard limb plus a
    mantissa-interval certificate settles the root without computing the
    remainder or the final square, reconstructing them only in the ambiguous
    band (~2⁻⁵⁷ of inputs, plus perfect squares).
  - *powermod:* sliding-window exponentiation reducing each product with
    Montgomery `redc!` (`src/montgomery.jl`, odd moduli) or `divrem!` (even)
    at small sizes, and above per-parity thresholds (~68 limbs odd, ~240
    even) a plain-domain Barrett reduction (HAC 14.42, `src/barrett.jl`)
    whose two per-product multiplies ride `mul!`.
  - *radix conversion* for `string`/`parse`: power-of-two bases pack/unpack
    bit windows directly (O(n)); other bases use per-limb `divrem_1!` /
    Horner below `STR_DC_THRESHOLD` (40 limbs) and a recursive
    split/combine around a `bb^(2^i)` power tree above, for O(M(n) log n)
    (the recursion lives in `src/nbig.jl`).

- **`NBig` (`src/nbig.jl`):** sign-magnitude value type
  (`signlen = sign * limb count`, little-endian normalized `Memory{UInt64}`),
  covering comparison, `+`/`-`/`*`, `divrem`/`div`/`rem`/`mod`/`fld`/`cld`,
  shifts, two's-complement bitwise ops, `^`, base 2–36 string conversion,
  and conversions to/from `Int64`/`UInt64`/`Int128`/`BigInt`/`Float64`.

## Benchmarks

`bench/bench_highlevel.jl` compares `NBig` against `Base.BigInt` end-to-end
(construction not included) across the target bit-size regime. Ratio is
NBig time / BigInt time — lower is better; ≤1.0 means NBig is faster.
Shapes: `divrem` is 2n/n; `gcd`/`gcdx` operands share a planted n/2-bit
factor; `powermod` uses an n-bit modulus and a 512-bit-capped exponent.

| op | 128 | 256 | 512 | 1k | 2k | 4k | 8k | 16k | 32k |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+` | 0.51 | 0.55 | 0.92 | 0.60 | 0.88 | 0.75 | 1.02 | 1.48 | 1.21 |
| `-` | 0.53 | 0.50 | 0.89 | 0.60 | 0.83 | 0.88 | 1.17 | 1.82 | 1.55 |
| `*` | 0.50 | 0.61 | 0.87 | 0.87 | 1.12 | 1.19 | 1.12 | 0.84 | 0.65 |
| `divrem` | 0.41 | 0.37 | 0.66 | 0.86 | 1.05 | 0.82 | 0.88 | 1.04 | 1.10 |
| `gcd` | 1.04 | 1.11 | 1.09 | 1.08 | 1.16 | 1.09 | 1.06 | 0.99 | 0.81 |
| `gcdx` | 1.01 | 0.99 | 1.25 | 1.25 | 1.25 | 1.22 | 1.12 | 0.97 | 0.79 |
| `isqrt` | 0.81 | 0.96 | 1.14 | 1.09 | 1.12 | 1.14 | 1.07 | 1.05 | 0.94 |
| `powermod` (odd) | 2.00 | 1.14 | 1.95 | 1.67 | 1.36 | 1.33 | 1.48 | 1.07 | 0.76 |
| `powermod` (even) | 2.05 | 2.31 | 1.98 | 1.82 | 1.15 | 1.11 | 1.36 | 1.06 | 0.77 |

The broad shape: the core ring ops (`+`/`-`/`*`/`divrem`) beat GMP through
~4k bits and `*` pulls ahead again from ~10k as the fp NTT takes over
(`+`/`-` drift behind at 8k+, where both sides are memory-bound and GMP's
in-place reallocation wins). `gcd`/`gcdx` sit within ~25% throughout and
lead from ~16k. `powermod` pays GMP's assembly-Montgomery tax at small
sizes, reaches parity around 16k bits, and leads by ~25% at 32k where
Barrett reduction rides the NTT. `isqrt` sits within ~15% of GMP across the
range (per-input variance ±15%): the root-only divappr top level plus the
normalized-divisor level step and pool-sized allocations closed the former
~40% mid-range gap. Decimal `string`/`parse` are supported and benchmarked
in `bench_highlevel.jl` but slower than GMP's.

At the kernel level, Karatsuba carries ~2k–10k bits at rough GMP parity
(0.95–1.09× against `__gmpn_mul`, trading blows with GMP's hand-tuned Toom
assembly), and the two-prime fp NTT takes over at ~10k bits already ahead
(`bench/bench_kernels.jl mul`, AVX-512 machine; ratio is `mul!` /
`__gmpn_mul` on two equal operands):

| bits | 10k  | 16k  | 33k  | 49k  | 66k  | 98k  | 131k | 262k | 524k | 2.1M | 16.8M | 268M |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|------|
| `*`  | 0.90 | 0.68 | 0.52 | 0.46 | 0.38 | 0.35 | 0.30 | 0.29 | 0.25 | 0.27 | 0.25  | 0.46 |

The lead reaches 2–4× from ~35k bits up, including the range where GMP has
switched to its own Schönhage–Strassen FFT. Squaring crosses over at the
same point with a similar lead. The fixed-prime chunk width shrinks slowly
as operands grow (the ratio drifting up in the 268M-bit column), but the
two-prime working modulus keeps the engine ahead through the largest sizes
that fit in memory.

Kernel- and threshold-level benchmarks against GMP's `__gmpn_*` functions
live in `bench/bench_kernels.jl`, a family-selecting driver (`micro`,
`mul`, `sqr`, `div`, `kar`, `dc`, `gcd`, `mullo`, `barrett`, `sqrt`); run
it with no args for the family list.
